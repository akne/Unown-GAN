# Unown-GAN Notebook
This directory contains the notebook used to handle the dataset and train the model. The notebook can be used within a Jupyter environment either locally or through Google Colabotory (and other services).

This will likely be revisited in the future to add documentation/comments regarding each cell, and to properly augment the dataset to allow for better results, as opposed to creating a bunch of random batches with potentially duplicate images.
